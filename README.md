## Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up the project locally and start the development server.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or later
- pip (Python package installer)
- Virtualenv (optional but recommended)
- Docker (optional, for containerization)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/laughlab.git
cd laughlab
```
2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended):
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```
3. Install Dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Application
To run the Flask development server:
```bash
python app.py
```
The app will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Development
### Virtual Environment
Using a virtual environment is highly recommended to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
### Local Testing
To run tests:
1. Install Testing Dependencies:
Include any testing dependencies in your `requirements.txt` or use a separate `requirements-dev.txt`.

2. Run Tests:
```bash
pytest tests/
```
### Linting and Code Style
Adhere to PEP 8 using flake8 for linting:
1. Install `flake8`:
```bash
pip install flake8
```
2. Run Linting:
```bash
flake8 .
```
You can configure `flake8` by modifying the `.flake8` file.

## Deployment
### Docker
You can containerize the application using Docker.
1. Build the Docker Image:
```bash
docker build -t laughlab .
```
2. Run the Docker Container:
```bash
docker run --name laughlab -d -p 5000:5000 laughlab
```
The app will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

### Production
For production deployment, use a robust WSGI server like Waitress.
**Run with Waitress:**
```bash
waitress-serve --port=5000 app:app
```
